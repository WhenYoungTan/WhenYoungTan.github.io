              <h2>Gaming</h2>
              <h4>Do I really need to explain this? Gaming is such a fun and convenient form of escapism from our stressful and hectic lives;
                  it is a great way to create bonds and socialise and it helps pass the time. Gaming is just so prevalent in our lives (maybe too prevalent for our own good).
                  My favorite genres are strategy and sandbox, especially if they are multiplayers. After a long day at work/school, I would just relax and destress by gaming with friends.</h4>

              <h2>Cooking</h2>
              <h4>My joy of cooking came from my mum, who regularly cooks for us and whose food makes up a bulk of my childhood. I would usually help her in food prep and learn some basic cooking skills from her, which serves as a bonding activity between me and my mum.
                  Although cooking can be quite time consuming, it can be quite rewarding. I mean, you may need to put in hours of work of preparation just to have it eaten in just 10 minutes.
                  But that 10 minutes of eating is just so rewarding; you can taste the fruits of your labour. This love for homecooked food is made further by my time in national service, where I have to eat army food all day long(Yuck!).
                  Cooking your own food also gives you the freedom to choose how you want your food to be. It's like a palette: Too bland? No problemo, just add more seasoning. Dieting? Use healthier ingredients.
                  Plus, it's much cheaper to cook your own food compared to takeout.</h4>

              <h2>Volunteering</h2>
              <h4>Helping those in need is a fulfilling and meaningful cause. As a volunteer, my actions will help to improve the community in one way or another.
                  This idea of helping those in need pushes me to volunteer more. Though it is hard work without any form of material gains, seeing the smiles on my beneficiaries' faces really made it worth the work.
                  I also learnt alot from both my beneficiaries and fellow volunteers, who shared their experience and gave a good chat. I would love to keep volunteering but given my current schedule as a conscript, I am starting to find it harder to have such commitments.</h4>
